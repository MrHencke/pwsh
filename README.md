# About

This is my personal powershell profile, filled with random utility functions and a riced starship prompt.


## Installation steps
- Ensure you have Powershell 7+ installed (`winget install Microsoft.Powershell`)
- Clone this repo into your userprofile location (usually Documents/Powershell)
- Ensure your executionpolicy is at least remotesigned (`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine`)
- If script execution is blocked, unblock the files from this repo with Unblock-File
- Start a shell in Powershell 7+, allow init process to run
- If changes are made to the init script, you can rerun it manually using `Init`
